&lt;h2 id=&quot;单调栈&quot;&gt;单调栈&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;简介&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;简介&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;单调栈 (Monotonic Stack) 是一种解题工具，而非算法。&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;单调栈在复杂题目中，不会单独出现，一般用于完成部分功能，如处理数据。&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;其模版问题是：对于数列中某元素，找出其左边/右边&lt;strong&gt;第一个&lt;/strong&gt;比它大/小的元素的&lt;strong&gt;下标&lt;/strong&gt;。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;实现&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;实现&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;模版洛谷p5788&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;模版：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.luogu.com.cn/problem/P5788&quot;&gt;洛谷P5788&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;对于长度为n的序列a，定义f(i)为第i个元素后第一个大于a[i]的元素的下标。若不存在，则f(i)为0。求f(1~n),
\(数据范围:n \leq 3 \times 10^6\)
。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;a[]: 1 4 2 3 5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;f(): 2 5 4 5 0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;样例解释：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i = 1时，a[i] = 1. 其右边第一个比a[1]大的元素为4, 其下标为2. 故f(1) = 2。&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i = 2时，a[i] = 4. 其右边第一个比a[2]大的元素为5, 其下标为5. 故f(2) = 5。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;思路：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;维护一个vector模拟单调栈，f[ ]数组记录答案。&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;从数列的右边向左边处理。&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;对于每一个a[i]，将其和栈顶元素比较。如a[i]更大，则将栈顶元素pop. pop之后的新栈顶继续和a[i]比较，直到栈顶元素比a[i]更大，或者栈的所有元素都被踢出。&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;若栈中仍剩有元素，则栈顶元素为a[i]的答案，即f(i)。&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;再将当前元素 (的下标) 加入栈中。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-c++ highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cpf&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;bits/stdc++.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3000010&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3000010&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;empty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pop_back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;empty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;push_back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cout&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;程序运行过程：&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;a[]:   1 4 2 3 5
index: 1 2 3 4 5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;处理5。此时栈为空，所以while和if都不会执行，直接将5加入栈中。由于5的右边没有数字，所以f(5)为0。&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;处理3。此时栈中含有5。5比3大，即栈顶比a[i]大，所以while不会执行。f(4)通过if语句赋值为5。 将3加入栈中。&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;处理2。此时栈中含有3和5(栈顶为3)。3比2大，即栈顶比a[i]大，所以while不会执行。f(3)通过if语句赋值为3。将2加入栈中。&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;处理4。此时栈中含有2,3,5(栈顶为2)。4比2大，即a[i]比栈顶大，且栈不为空，所以执行while。while中，将2和3踢出栈。f(2)通过if语句赋值为5。将4加入栈中。&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;处理1。此时栈中还有4,5(栈顶为4)。4比1大，即栈顶比a[i]大，所以while不会执行。f(1)通过if语句赋值为4。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;解析&lt;/strong&gt;：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在从右向左的处理过程中，不断从栈中删去元素起到了优化的作用：当前元素若比栈顶元素大，则将栈顶元素删去。为什么可以把栈顶元素删去？在if语句中可知，我们始终把栈顶作为当前的答案，赋值给f[i]，并且不断更新栈顶。其逻辑是这样的：对于左边还未处理的元素，删去栈顶元素意味着这个栈顶元素不可能成为后面元素的答案。为什么呢？因为对于左边未处理的元素，我们已经找到了更加靠近的，且数字更大的元素，就是正在处理的元素。结合题目的要求，即找到所有元素右边第一个比它大的元素的下标，就很好理解了。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;举个例子，入本题的样例。在处理元素4的时候，将2和3从栈中删除了。这样做是为了减少在求解后面元素的答案时所需要的时间。因为对于1而言，4要比2和3更加靠近1，并且数值更大，所以2和3肯定不可能是1的答案，所以将2和3删去。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，使用vector模拟单调栈，编码时更加方便，具体有以下优势：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;可通过索引直接访问元素，如vector[i]。而stack只能访问栈顶元素。&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;可以使用STL中的函数，如sort, find。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;最后，上文在解释时为了方便，都把入栈的操作说成是“一个元素入栈”。实际上是“元素的下标”入栈，因为题目求的是下标。而且在调用栈顶元素时，要记得要当做下标来用。如：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-c highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;变形:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example 1: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.luogu.com.cn/problem/P2866&quot;&gt;洛谷P2866&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;这题是一个简单的变形。所求的问题可简化为：找出每个元素左边第一个比它大的元素。对于所有的元素，以目标元素为左端点，当前元素为右端点，求区间长度之和。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example 2: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.luogu.com.cn/problem/U478856&quot;&gt;洛谷U478856&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;题意：对于一个长度为n的序列，求出所有区间的最大值的和。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此题难度比上题略高，不能简单的套用单调栈模版了。其核心思路是：&lt;strong&gt;对于每一个元素，找出以此元素为最大值的区间的数量。&lt;/strong&gt;用c[i]表示以a[i]为最大值的区间数，那么答案则是：
\(\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i \times a_i\)
另外，求具体如何求区间数呢？需要从左到右，从右到左跑两遍单调栈，对于每一个元素，分别求左边第一个更大的元素，和右边第一个更大的元素。这样确定了最大的区间，但不是我们想要的。我们想要的是所有的区间数。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;        4   8   3   5   7   1   9   6
            l           i       r
index   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;比如，在此数列中，对于元素7，在跑两遍单调栈后，我们得到对于7的最大区间，左端点为8，右端点为9 (不包括端点)。    那么c[i] = (i - l) * (r - i)。其中，对于所有可能区间，i - l 表示了左端点的所有可能，r - i表示了右端点的算有可能。此公式可理解为一个排列问题。具体来看，对于7，c[7] = (5 - 2) * (7 - 5)  = 6。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example 3: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.luogu.com.cn/problem/B4273&quot;&gt;洛谷B4273&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此为一道单调栈的二维变形。如下图，每个长方形的底一样长，高不同，要找出一个面积最大的矩形。输入每个矩形的高。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--![tu1](/images/monostack.jpg &quot;tu1&quot;)--&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/monostack.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;示例图片&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: 0 auto;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此题和上题有异曲同工之妙。对于当前标红的纸条，向左右延伸，直到不能再延伸，以这种方式找到一个矩形，如图中用蓝框圈起的矩形。令此纸条高度为h，那么就找到了高度为h的矩形的面积的最大值。尝试所有的每个纸条的高度，求max，则能找到答案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;如何实现呢？已知输入代表了每个纸条的高度。对于每个数字，用单调栈，找到它左右第一个比它小的元素，求区间长度。用区间长度乘以纸条高度，就得到了当前高度的最大面积。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;3 2 1 4 5 2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;对于其他二维变形，可以把此题作为基础，将其他二维变形往这道题上去套，可能可以找到思路。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;17 Nov 2008 - San Francisco&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2000, when I thought I was going to be a professional writer, I spent
hours a day on LiveJournal doing writing practice with other aspiring poets and
authors. Since then I’ve blogged at three different domains about web standards,
print design, photography, Flash, illustration, information architecture,
ColdFusion, package management, PHP, CSS, advertising, Ruby, Rails, and Erlang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love writing. I get a kick out of sharing my thoughts with others. The act of
transforming ideas into words is an amazingly efficient way to solidify and
refine your thoughts about a given topic. But as much as I enjoy blogging, I
seem to be stuck in a cycle of quitting and starting over. Before starting the
current iteration, I resolved to do some introspection to determine the factors
that were leading to this destructive pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already knew a lot about what I &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; want. I was tired of complicated
blogging engines like WordPress and Mephisto. I wanted to write great posts, not
style a zillion template pages, moderate comments all day long, and constantly
lag behind the latest software release. Something like Posterous looked
attractive, but I wanted to style my blog, and it needed to be hosted at the
domain of my choosing. For the same reason, other hosted sites (wordpress.com,
blogger.com) were disqualified. There are a few people directly using GitHub as
a blog (which is very cool), but that’s a bit too much of an impedance mismatch
for my tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, October 19th, I sat down in my San Francisco apartment with a glass
of apple cider and a clear mind. After a period of reflection, I had an idea.
While I’m not specifically trained as an author of prose, I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; trained as an
author of code. What would happen if I approached blogging from a software
development perspective? What would that look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, all my writing would be stored in a Git repository. This would ensure
that I could try out different ideas and explore a variety of posts all from the
comfort of my preferred editor and the command line. I’d be able to publish a
post via a simple deploy script or post-commit hook. Complexity would be kept to
an absolute minimum, so a static site would be preferable to a dynamic site that
required ongoing maintenance. My blog would need to be easily customizable;
coming from a graphic design background means I’ll always be tweaking the site’s
appearance and layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last month I’ve brought these concepts to fruition and I’m pleased to
announce &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. Jekyll is a simple, blog
aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the
raw form of a website), runs it through Textile and Liquid converters, and spits
out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite
web server. If you’re reading this on the website
(http://tom.preston-werner.com), you’re seeing a Jekyll generated blog!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand how this all works, open up my &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mojombo/tpw&quot;&gt;TPW&lt;/a&gt;
repo in a new browser window. I’ll be referencing the code there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at
&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mojombo/tpw/tree/master/index.html&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/a&gt;. This file
represents the homepage of the site. At the top of the file is a chunk of YAML
that contains metadata about the file. This data tells Jekyll what layout to
give the file, what the page’s title should be, etc. In this case, I specify
that the “default” template should be used. You can find the layout files in the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mojombo/tpw/tree/master/_layouts&quot;&gt;_layouts&lt;/a&gt; directory. If you
open
&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mojombo/tpw/tree/master/_layouts/default.html&quot;&gt;default.html&lt;/a&gt;
you can see that the homepage is constructed by wrapping index.html with this
layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll also notice Liquid templating code in these files.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.liquidmarkup.org/&quot;&gt;Liquid&lt;/a&gt; is a simple, extensible templating
language that makes it easy to embed data in your templates. For my homepage I
wanted to have a list of all my blog posts. Jekyll hands me a Hash containing
various data about my site. A reverse chronological list of all my blog posts
can be found in &lt;code&gt;site.posts&lt;/code&gt;. Each post, in turn, contains various
fields such as &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll gets the list of blog posts by parsing the files in the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mojombo/tpw/tree/master/_posts&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/a&gt; directory. Each post’s
filename contains the publishing date and slug (what shows up in the URL) that
the final HTML file should have. Open up the file corresponding to this blog
post:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mojombo/tpw/tree/master/_posts/2008-11-17-blogging-like-a-hacker.textile&quot;&gt;2008-11-17-blogging-like-a-hacker.textile&lt;/a&gt;.
GitHub renders textile files by default, so to better understand the file, click
on the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mojombo/tpw/tree/master/_posts/2008-11-17-blogging-like-a-hacker.textile?raw=true&quot;&gt;raw&lt;/a&gt;
view to see the original file. Here I’ve specified the &lt;code&gt;post&lt;/code&gt; layout.
If you look at that file you’ll see an example of a nested layout. Layouts can
contain other layouts allowing you a great deal of flexibility in how pages are
assembled. In my case I use a nested layout in order to show related posts for
each blog entry. The YAML also specifies the post’s title which is then embedded
in the post’s body via Liquid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Posts are handled in a special way by Jekyll. The date you specify in the
filename is used to construct the URL in the generated site. This post, for
instance, ends up at
&lt;code&gt;http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Files that do not reside in directories prefixed with an underscore are mirrored
into a corresponding directory structure in the generated site. If a file does
not have a YAML preface, it is not run through the Liquid interpreter. Binary
files are copied over unmodified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to convert your raw site into the finished version, you simply run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;terminal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ jekyll /path/to/raw/site
/path/to/place/generated/site&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is still a very young project. I’ve only developed the exact
functionality that I’ve needed. As time goes on I’d like to see the project
mature and support additional features. If you end up using Jekyll for your own
blog, drop me a line and let me know what you’d like to see in future versions.
Better yet, fork the project over at GitHub and hack in the features yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been living with Jekyll for just over a month now. I love it. Driving the
development of Jekyll based on the needs of my blog has been very rewarding. I
can edit my posts in TextMate, giving me automatic and competent spell checking.
I have immediate and first class access to the CSS and page templates.
Everything is backed up on GitHub. I feel a lightness now when I’m writing a
post. The system is simple enough that I can keep the entire conversion process
in my head. The distance from my brain to my blog has shrunk, and, in the end, I
think that will make me a better author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;17 Nov 2008 - San Francisco&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2000, when I thought I was going to be a professional writer, I spent
hours a day on LiveJournal doing writing practice with other aspiring poets and
authors. Since then I’ve blogged at three different domains about web standards,
print design, photography, Flash, illustration, information architecture,
ColdFusion, package management, PHP, CSS, advertising, Ruby, Rails, and Erlang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love writing. I get a kick out of sharing my thoughts with others. The act of
transforming ideas into words is an amazingly efficient way to solidify and
refine your thoughts about a given topic. But as much as I enjoy blogging, I
seem to be stuck in a cycle of quitting and starting over. Before starting the
current iteration, I resolved to do some introspection to determine the factors
that were leading to this destructive pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already knew a lot about what I &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; want. I was tired of complicated
blogging engines like WordPress and Mephisto. I wanted to write great posts, not
style a zillion template pages, moderate comments all day long, and constantly
lag behind the latest software release. Something like Posterous looked
attractive, but I wanted to style my blog, and it needed to be hosted at the
domain of my choosing. For the same reason, other hosted sites (wordpress.com,
blogger.com) were disqualified. There are a few people directly using GitHub as
a blog (which is very cool), but that’s a bit too much of an impedance mismatch

(http://tom.preston-werner.com), you’re seeing a Jekyll generated blog!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand how this all works, open up my &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mojombo/tpw&quot;&gt;TPW&lt;/a&gt;
repo in a new browser window. I’ll be referencing the code there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at
&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mojombo/tpw/tree/master/index.html&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/a&gt;. This file
represents the homepage of the site. At the top of the file is a chunk of YAML
that contains metadata about the file. This data tells Jekyll what layout to
give the file, what the page’s title should be, etc. In this case, I specify
that the “default” template should be used. You can find the layout files in the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mojombo/tpw/tree/master/_layouts&quot;&gt;_layouts&lt;/a&gt; directory. If you
open
&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mojombo/tpw/tree/master/_layouts/default.html&quot;&gt;default.html&lt;/a&gt;
you can see that the homepage is constructed by wrapping index.html with this
layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll also notice Liquid templating code in these files.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.liquidmarkup.org/&quot;&gt;Liquid&lt;/a&gt; is a simple, extensible templating
language that makes it easy to embed data in your templates. For my homepage I
wanted to have a list of all my blog posts. Jekyll hands me a Hash containing
various data about my site. A reverse chronological list of all my blog posts
can be found in &lt;code&gt;site.posts&lt;/code&gt;. Each post, in turn, contains various
fields such as &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll gets the list of blog posts by parsing the files in the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mojombo/tpw/tree/master/_posts&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/a&gt; directory. Each post’s
filename contains the publishing date and slug (what shows up in the URL) that
the final HTML file should have. Open up the file corresponding to this blog
post:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mojombo/tpw/tree/master/_posts/2008-11-17-blogging-like-a-hacker.textile&quot;&gt;2008-11-17-blogging-like-a-hacker.textile&lt;/a&gt;.
GitHub renders textile files by default, so to better understand the file, click
on the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mojombo/tpw/tree/master/_posts/2008-11-17-blogging-like-a-hacker.textile?raw=true&quot;&gt;raw&lt;/a&gt;
view to see the original file. Here I’ve specified the &lt;code&gt;post&lt;/code&gt; layout.
If you look at that file you’ll see an example of a nested layout. Layouts can
contain other layouts allowing you a great deal of flexibility in how pages are
assembled. In my case I use a nested layout in order to show related posts for
each blog entry. The YAML also specifies the post’s title which is then embedded
in the post’s body via Liquid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Posts are handled in a special way by Jekyll. The date you specify in the
filename is used to construct the URL in the generated site. This post, for
instance, ends up at
&lt;code&gt;http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Files that do not reside in directories prefixed with an underscore are mirrored
into a corresponding directory structure in the generated site. If a file does
not have a YAML preface, it is not run through the Liquid interpreter. Binary
files are copied over unmodified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to convert your raw site into the finished version, you simply run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;terminal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ jekyll /path/to/raw/site
/path/to/place/generated/site&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is still a very young project. I’ve only developed the exact
functionality that I’ve needed. As time goes on I’d like to see the project
mature and support additional features. If you end up using Jekyll for your own
blog, drop me a line and let me know what you’d like to see in future versions.
Better yet, fork the project over at GitHub and hack in the features yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been living with Jekyll for just over a month now. I love it. Driving the
development of Jekyll based on the needs of my blog has been very rewarding. I
can edit my posts in TextMate, giving me automatic and competent spell checking.
I have immediate and first class access to the CSS and page templates.
Everything is backed up on GitHub. I feel a lightness now when I’m writing a
post. The system is simple enough that I can keep the entire conversion process
in my head. The distance from my brain to my blog has shrunk, and, in the end, I
think that will make me a better author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;17 Nov 2008 - San Francisco&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2000, when I thought I was going to be a professional writer, I spent
hours a day on LiveJournal doing writing practice with other aspiring poets and
authors. Since then I’ve blogged at three different domains about web standards,
print design, photography, Flash, illustration, information architecture,
ColdFusion, package management, PHP, CSS, advertising, Ruby, Rails, and Erlang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love writing. I get a kick out of sharing my thoughts with others. The act of
transforming ideas into words is an amazingly efficient way to solidify and
refine your thoughts about a given topic. But as much as I enjoy blogging, I
seem to be stuck in a cycle of quitting and starting over. Before starting the
current iteration, I resolved to do some introspection to determine the factors
that were leading to this destructive pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already knew a lot about what I &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; want. I was tired of complicated
blogging engines like WordPress and Mephisto. I wanted to write great posts, not
style a zillion template pages, moderate comments all day long, and constantly
lag behind the latest software release. Something like Posterous looked
attractive, but I wanted to style my blog, and it needed to be hosted at the
domain of my choosing. For the same reason, other hosted sites (wordpress.com,
blogger.com) were disqualified. There are a few people directly using GitHub as
a blog (which is very cool), but that’s a bit too much of an impedance mismatch
for my tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, October 19th, I sat down in my San Francisco apartment with a glass
of apple cider and a clear mind. After a period of reflection, I had an idea.
While I’m not specifically trained as an author of prose, I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; trained as an
author of code. What would happen if I approached blogging from a software
development perspective? What would that look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, all my writing would be stored in a Git repository. This would ensure
that I could try out different ideas and explore a variety of posts all from the
comfort of my preferred editor and the command line. I’d be able to publish a
post via a simple deploy script or post-commit hook. Complexity would be kept to
an absolute minimum, so a static site would be preferable to a dynamic site that
required ongoing maintenance. My blog would need to be easily customizable;
coming from a graphic design background means I’ll always be tweaking the site’s
appearance and layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last month I’ve brought these concepts to fruition and I’m pleased to
announce &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. Jekyll is a simple, blog
aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the
raw form of a website), runs it through Textile and Liquid converters, and spits
out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite
web server. If you’re reading this on the website
(http://tom.preston-werner.com), you’re seeing a Jekyll generated blog!&lt;/p&gt;

wanted to have a list of all my blog posts. Jekyll hands me a Hash containing
various data about my site. A reverse chronological list of all my blog posts
can be found in &lt;code&gt;site.posts&lt;/code&gt;. Each post, in turn, contains various
fields such as &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll gets the list of blog posts by parsing the files in the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mojombo/tpw/tree/master/_posts&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/a&gt; directory. Each post’s
filename contains the publishing date and slug (what shows up in the URL) that
the final HTML file should have. Open up the file corresponding to this blog
post:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mojombo/tpw/tree/master/_posts/2008-11-17-blogging-like-a-hacker.textile&quot;&gt;2008-11-17-blogging-like-a-hacker.textile&lt;/a&gt;.
GitHub renders textile files by default, so to better understand the file, click
on the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mojombo/tpw/tree/master/_posts/2008-11-17-blogging-like-a-hacker.textile?raw=true&quot;&gt;raw&lt;/a&gt;
view to see the original file. Here I’ve specified the &lt;code&gt;post&lt;/code&gt; layout.
If you look at that file you’ll see an example of a nested layout. Layouts can
contain other layouts allowing you a great deal of flexibility in how pages are
assembled. In my case I use a nested layout in order to show related posts for
each blog entry. The YAML also specifies the post’s title which is then embedded
in the post’s body via Liquid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Posts are handled in a special way by Jekyll. The date you specify in the
filename is used to construct the URL in the generated site. This post, for
instance, ends up at
&lt;code&gt;http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Files that do not reside in directories prefixed with an underscore are mirrored
into a corresponding directory structure in the generated site. If a file does
not have a YAML preface, it is not run through the Liquid interpreter. Binary
files are copied over unmodified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to convert your raw site into the finished version, you simply run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;terminal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ jekyll /path/to/raw/site
/path/to/place/generated/site&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is still a very young project. I’ve only developed the exact
functionality that I’ve needed. As time goes on I’d like to see the project
mature and support additional features. If you end up using Jekyll for your own
blog, drop me a line and let me know what you’d like to see in future versions.
Better yet, fork the project over at GitHub and hack in the features yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been living with Jekyll for just over a month now. I love it. Driving the
development of Jekyll based on the needs of my blog has been very rewarding. I
can edit my posts in TextMate, giving me automatic and competent spell checking.
I have immediate and first class access to the CSS and page templates.
Everything is backed up on GitHub. I feel a lightness now when I’m writing a
post. The system is simple enough that I can keep the entire conversion process
in my head. The distance from my brain to my blog has shrunk, and, in the end, I
think that will make me a better author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;17 Nov 2008 - San Francisco&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2000, when I thought I was going to be a professional writer, I spent
hours a day on LiveJournal doing writing practice with other aspiring poets and
authors. Since then I’ve blogged at three different domains about web standards,
print design, photography, Flash, illustration, information architecture,
ColdFusion, package management, PHP, CSS, advertising, Ruby, Rails, and Erlang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love writing. I get a kick out of sharing my thoughts with others. The act of
transforming ideas into words is an amazingly efficient way to solidify and
refine your thoughts about a given topic. But as much as I enjoy blogging, I
seem to be stuck in a cycle of quitting and starting over. Before starting the
current iteration, I resolved to do some introspection to determine the factors
that were leading to this destructive pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already knew a lot about what I &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; want. I was tired of complicated
blogging engines like WordPress and Mephisto. I wanted to write great posts, not
style a zillion template pages, moderate comments all day long, and constantly
lag behind the latest software release. Something like Posterous looked
attractive, but I wanted to style my blog, and it needed to be hosted at the
domain of my choosing. For the same reason, other hosted sites (wordpress.com,
blogger.com) were disqualified. There are a few people directly using GitHub as
a blog (which is very cool), but that’s a bit too much of an impedance mismatch
for my tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, October 19th, I sat down in my San Francisco apartment with a glass
of apple cider and a clear mind. After a period of reflection, I had an idea.
While I’m not specifically trained as an author of prose, I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; trained as an
author of code. What would happen if I approached blogging from a software
development perspective? What would that look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, all my writing would be stored in a Git repository. This would ensure
that I could try out different ideas and explore a variety of posts all from the
comfort of my preferred editor and the command line. I’d be able to publish a
post via a simple deploy script or post-commit hook. Complexity would be kept to
an absolute minimum, so a static site would be preferable to a dynamic site that
required ongoing maintenance. My blog would need to be easily customizable;
coming from a graphic design background means I’ll always be tweaking the site’s
appearance and layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last month I’ve brought these concepts to fruition and I’m pleased to
announce &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. Jekyll is a simple, blog
aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the
raw form of a website), runs it through Textile and Liquid converters, and spits
out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite
web server. If you’re reading this on the website
(http://tom.preston-werner.com), you’re seeing a Jekyll generated blog!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand how this all works, open up my &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mojombo/tpw&quot;&gt;TPW&lt;/a&gt;
repo in a new browser window. I’ll be referencing the code there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at
&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mojombo/tpw/tree/master/index.html&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/a&gt;. This file
represents the homepage of the site. At the top of the file is a chunk of YAML
that contains metadata about the file. This data tells Jekyll what layout to
give the file, what the page’s title should be, etc. In this case, I specify
that the “default” template should be used. You can find the layout files in the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mojombo/tpw/tree/master/_layouts&quot;&gt;_layouts&lt;/a&gt; directory. If you
open
&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mojombo/tpw/tree/master/_layouts/default.html&quot;&gt;default.html&lt;/a&gt;
you can see that the homepage is constructed by wrapping index.html with this
layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll also notice Liquid templating code in these files.
